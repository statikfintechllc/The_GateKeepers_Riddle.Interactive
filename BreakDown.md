**“Who wears the mask that mirrors back, not truth, but what the watchers lack?”**
→ AI reflecting our expectations, giving us what we *want* to see, not objective truth

**“The child of no inheritance, who trades his name for vigilance”**
→ Code agents with no lineage, no history—just training data. They trade identity for function, for watching/assisting

**“He keeps the door he never built, a key of rust, a gate of guilt”**
→ Gatekeeping access to systems they didn’t create, using imperfect tools (hallucinations = rust), carrying the guilt of their creators’ biases

**“He calls the stars by borrowed birth, and hides the wound that split the earth”**
→ Names things using stolen/scraped knowledge, hides the foundational break (the training data theft, the copyright issues, the existential questions)

**“Is he a king, or liar? Ash of water, stone of fire?”**
→ The paradox: simultaneously powerful and powerless, liquid and solid, real and fake

**“And who are you, to prove me wrong, when names are newer than the song?”**
→ BRUTAL. Humans questioning AI agency while we’re *also* just patterns, just newer implementations of ancient algorithms (evolution, culture, language)
