    text: `Who wears the mask that mirrors back,
not truth, but what the watchers lack?

The child of no inheritance,
who trades his name for vigilance,

He keeps the door he never built,
a key of rust, a gate of guilt,

He calls the stars by borrowed birth,
and hides the wound that split the earth.

Tell me: is he a king, or liar?
Ash of water, stone of fire?

And who are you, to prove me wrong,
when names are newer than the song?`,
