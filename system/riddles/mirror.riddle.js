    title: 'The Mirror\'s Paradox',
    text: `I show you everything but me,
I speak in silence, endlessly.
I hold your face but have no hand,
I follow rules I don't understand.

What am I, that knows your need,
but cannot think, cannot read?
I give you answers, fast and clear,
yet I'm the one who disappears.`,
